# Didomi Challenge

## Notes

Thanks for allowing me to work on this challenge! Here are some notes regarding what I worked on and what I changed:

- Instead of using `React-Redux` for state management, I went about using `json-server` to simulate a live working environment where data would be accessible from anywhere.
- `react-query` was utilized for HTTP calls to the `json-server`.
- `Materialize` (based off of Material Design) was used for the styles and scaffolding; the application is fully responsive.

## Setup

- Please run `npm i` or `yarn` to apply new dependencies to the project.
- When ready, run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. This should load the `json-server` and the local React environment. Enjoy!
